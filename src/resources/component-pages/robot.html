                <li class="component-list-element">The backbone of the robot is the frame assembly. All of the 
                    other components attach to it directly which allows us to change and fix systems easily, 
                    something which was a problem with  V3. We designed V4 with design modularity being one of 
                    the main priorities.;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">We tried to combine simplicity with elegance during the 
                    design process. The first few versions of our robots were too complicated and were prone 
                    to breaking, hence why we understood that simplicity is directly linked to reliability 
                    and designed V4 having this in mind;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">We partnered up with other teams, shared different solutions 
                    with each other and learned from one another.</li>
