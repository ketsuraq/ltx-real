            <ul class="component-list">
                <li class="component-list-element">This season we made and used 3 different versions of our 
                    PEM system that used a plane carrier, guided through a REV 15 mm extrusion to launch the 
                    drone. We tried both springs and rubber band;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">On the current robot we have mounted the 3rd version of our 
                    Plane launcher. The base design was gifted to us by our good friends from the Netherlands 
                    (16409 Team Orange) that we met in the Benelux Championship. We have highly modified the 
                    design to suit our robotâ€™s needs better;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">The plane is launched when a servo releases the rubber 
                    band holding the drone;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">This plane mechanism allows the robot to consistently 
                    score 30 points during end game;</li>
                <li class="component-list-element">The plane is made from half of an A4 paper sheet and it 
                    has flaps on the back to slow it down during flight. This allows it to regularly land 
                    in the 30 point landing zone.</li>
